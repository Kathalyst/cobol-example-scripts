# IC228A.CBL

Here's a summary of the given COBOL code:

### File Handling
- Opens and writes to `PRINT-FILE` ("report.log")

### Data Structures
- `GLOBAL-DATA` (global):
  - `GLO-DATA-1`: PIC X(2)
  - `GLO-DATA-2`: PIC X(6)
  - `GLO-DATA-3`: PIC 9(8)
  - `GLO-DATA-4`: PIC 9(4)
- Various test result and reporting structures

### Main Procedure
- Initializes `GLOBAL-DATA`
- Calls subprogram `IC228A-1`
- Checks `GLOBAL-DATA` values after subprogram call
- Performs pass/fail checks and reporting

### Subprogram IC228A-1
- Modifies `GLOBAL-DATA` values
- Exits program

The code tests the COBOL "GLOBAL" clause functionality by modifying global data in a subprogram and verifying changes in the main program.
