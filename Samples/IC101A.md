# IC101A.CBL

Here's a summary of the given COBOL code file in markdown format:

### File Handling
- Opens and writes to `PRINT-FILE` ("report.log")

### Data Structures
- `DN1`, `DN2`: Single-digit signed numeric
- `TEST-RESULTS`, `TEST-COMPUTED`, `TEST-CORRECT`: Complex structures for test reporting
- Various counters and flags for test management

### Main Procedure
1. Initializes test environment
2. Performs five CALL tests:
   - Calls "IC102A" subprogram using `DN1` and `DN2` as parameters
   - Checks returned values in `DN1` and `DN2`
   - Verifies if returned values match expected results (1 to 5)
3. Reports test results (PASS/FAIL)
4. Closes files and terminates program

The program tests the CALL statement with one parameter in the USING phrase, checking if the called routine maintains its last used state across multiple calls.
