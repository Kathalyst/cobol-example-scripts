# IC112A.CBL

Here's a summary of the given COBOL code file:

### File Handling
- Uses sequential file "SQ-FS3" for input/output
- Creates file with 649 records, each 120 characters long
- Reads and verifies created file
- Closes and reopens file for input

### Data Structures
- FILE-RECORD-INFO-REC: Complex structure for file information
- SQ-FS3R1-F-G-120: 120-character record for SQ-FS3 file
- Various counters and flags (e.g., RECORDS-IN-ERROR, ERROR-FLAG)

### Inputs / Outputs
- Writes to PRINT-FILE for test results
- Reads from and writes to SQ-FS3 file

### Main Procedure
- Creates SQ-FS3 file (SEQ-TEST-007)
- Verifies created file (SEQ-TEST-008)
- Calls subprogram IC113A to check record fields (LINK-TEST-08)
- Tests AT END condition and calls IC113A (LINK-TEST-09)
- Performs various error checks and reporting
