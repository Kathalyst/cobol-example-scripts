# IC116M.CBL

Here's a summary of the given COBOL code file in markdown format:

### File Handling
- Opens and writes to `PRINT-FILE` ("report.log")

### Data Structures
- `PRINT-REC`: 120-character record for output
- `SUMMARY-MESSAGE-1` and `SUMMARY-MESSAGE-2`: Formatted messages
- `TEST-RESULTS`: Stores test result details
- Various counters and flags for test management

### Main Procedure
1. Performs initial setup (open files, print headers)
2. Executes `USNG-TEST-01`:
   - Calls subprogram "IC117M" without USING phrase
   - Writes test result
3. Prints summary messages
4. Performs cleanup and termination routines

The program tests the CALL statement without the optional USING phrase, calling subprograms IC117M and indirectly IC118M. It expects three display messages on the default display device to indicate success.
