# IC234A.CBL

### File Handling
- Uses TEST-FILE and PRINT-FILE
- OPEN, CLOSE, READ operations on TEST-FILE

### Data Structures
- DILFRAP: Global PIC 9
- TEST-RESULTS: Complex structure with various fields
- TEST-COMPUTED, TEST-CORRECT: Structures for test results

### Inputs / Outputs
- TEST-FILE: Input file
- PRINT-FILE: Output file for reports

### Main Procedure
- Nested program structure: IC234A (main) -> IC234A-1 -> IC234A-2 -> IC234A-3
- Tests USE procedures across nested programs
- DECLARATIVES sections in each program level
- Global USE procedure in main program
- Calls to nested programs to trigger USE procedures
- Increments DILFRAP in various USE procedures
